More specifically, we will explore the client’s demographics such as job, marital status, education, balance, housing, contact dates and their association with clients’ decision to subscribe to term deposit. We hope to determine whether the marketing campaign is effective and to what degree each demographic factor impact the marketing effectiveness."

    "1. Problem: We wanted to determine the association between the client's demographic factors and their likelihood of subscribing to the bank’s term deposit after the marketing calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. This is a classification problem because there are two non continuous, categorical results - yes or no (deposit). Therefore, when making the model, we basically will split the responses into two groups, clients that did subscribe to term deposit and the clients that didn’t. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. This is an inference problem. We are trying to answer how each demographic factors are associated with the clients’ decision to make a deposit most strongly (or their probability of making the deposit)  in order to evaluate marketing effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Our research project is a classification problem. We are most interested in exploring the relationship between client’s demographics (eg. job, marital status, education, balance, housing, contact dates) and their decision to subscribe to the term deposit. We want to use various metrics including accuracy, precision and recall. This will enable us to look at the problem from multiple  aspects and find a good balance among these measurements. We also plan to use ROC-AUC because it measures performance for the classification problems at various threshold settings. This is useful  because we can examine and determine the threshold of false positives/false negatives with this metric. A key objective of the project is to understand factors that are associated with marketing failure because we want to improve the cost-efficiency of the campaigns. Therefore, it’s important to minimize false positives (clients who do not subscribe to the deposit, but are classified by the model as marketing success) in order to better  target potential clients, improve marketing effectiveness, and lower  its cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To select the most relevant information, we  plan to first identify variables that have a strong correlation with the marketing outcome (yes-deposit or no-deposit). We want to use both visualizations and correlation matrix to understand the relationship between the variables and the response. Among these variables, some may be strongly correlated with others. For example, “housing” with “loan”, and “education” with “job”.  By using wrapper methods, such as forward selection, backward elimination, stepwise regression, we plan to create an appropriate subset of factors to use. We expect there are more failures (clients do not subscribe to term deposit)  than success (clients subscribing to term deposit). In order to make a more balanced training dataset, we will establish a subset of a sample, half of which will be success cases and the rest will be failure cases. \n"

In our expectation, the below predictors may be the most crucial in predicting a client's likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit: age, types of job, whether they have personal loan or house loan. \n",

Besides, we will use both false negative rate (FNR) and false positive rate (FPR) to further measurement, which should both perform better than the random classification. However, we might put more effort on reducing the FNR. For banks, the cost of phone-call is much lower than the loss of the potential profit of gaining a client who subscribes to a term deposit. Thus, FNR might be more important in this case. In conclusion, we will attempt to achieve higher accuracy and lower FNR in our model in order to avoid the loss of potential customers. "
